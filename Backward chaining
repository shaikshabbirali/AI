% Define the rules and facts

% Rule 1: If it rains, the grass gets wet.
rule(grass_wet) :-
    rain.

% Fact 1: It is raining today.
rain.

% Rule 2: If the grass is wet, the ground is damp.
rule(ground_damp) :-
    grass_wet.

% Fact 2: The grass is wet (derived from rule 1).
grass_wet.

% Rule 3: If the ground is damp, people track mud.
rule(people_track_mud) :-
    ground_damp.

% Query: What do we need to prove?
query(people_track_mud).

% Backward chaining algorithm
backward_chain(Goal) :-
    % If the goal is already a fact, succeed
    fact(Goal).

backward_chain(Goal) :-
    % Try to prove the goal by finding a rule that concludes with Goal
    rule(Goal),
    % Recursively prove the conditions of the rule
    backward_chain_condition(Goal).

backward_chain_condition(Goal) :-
    % For each condition of the rule, recursively prove it
    rule(Goal),
    % Recursively prove the conditions of the rule
    backward_chain_condition(Goal).

backward_chain_condition(Goal) :-
    % For each condition of the rule, recursively prove it
 Goal Fact recursively
